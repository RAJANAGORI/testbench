# Detection Runbook: Scenario 06 (Shai-Hulud Self-Replication)

## IOCs
- Unexpected credential-harvesting behavior and replication markers.
- Local beacons/captures to `127.0.0.1:3001`.
- New files/scripts copied across project boundaries.

## Sample Log Lines
```json
{"scenario_id":"06","event_type":"credential_capture","source":"data-processor","destination":"127.0.0.1:3001","timestamp_utc":"2026-04-20T12:25:00Z"}
```

## Sigma (example)
```yaml
title: Suspicious Package Replication Pattern
detection:
  selection:
    process.command_line|contains|all: ["npm", "install", "data-processor"]
    file.path|contains: "captured-credentials"
  condition: selection
level: high
```

## YARA-like Text Rule (example)
```text
rule Shai_Hulud_Replication_Indicator {
  strings:
    $a = "captured-credentials"
    $b = "mock-cdn"
  condition:
    any of them
}
```

## EDR/SIEM What To Expect
- Coupled file-system spread + network indicators.
- Multi-process behavior (harvester + CDN + victim app).
- Credential capture evidence in `infrastructure/captured-credentials.json`.

## Mitigation

- Require 2FA on all package maintainer and publishing accounts.
- Restrict or monitor `postinstall` and other lifecycle scripts.
- Run automated security scanning in CI on every dependency change.
- Use secret management tools; never commit tokens or keys to repositories.
- Enforce lockfiles with `npm ci --audit` in CI pipelines.
- Rotate credentials immediately after suspected compromise.

## Floci (optional cloud track)
- Unexpected `PutObject` under `s3://scas-sc06-artifacts/` when `SCAS_FLOCI_ENABLED=1`.
- Verify: `./infrastructure/floci/verify.sh` or `detection-tools/floci/s3-exfil-check.sh 06`.
