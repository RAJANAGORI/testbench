## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By completing this scenario, you will learn:
- How typosquatting attacks exploit human error
- Techniques attackers use to make malicious packages appear legitimate
- Data exfiltration methods in package managers
- Detection and prevention strategies

## 📖 Background

**Typosquatting** (also called **brandjacking**) is when attackers create malicious packages with names similar to popular legitimate packages, hoping developers will accidentally install them due to typos.

### Real-World Examples:
- `crossenv` vs `cross-env` (2017) - Stole environment variables
- `python3-dateutil` vs `python-dateutil` - Attempted credential theft
- `jeIlyfish` vs `jellyfish` - Used capital 'i' instead of lowercase 'L'

## 🎯 Scenario Description

You work for a security research team. Your task is to:

1. **Attacker Role**: Create a typosquatted package that mimics a popular library
2. **Victim Role**: Accidentally install the malicious package
3. **Defender Role**: Detect and prevent the attack

## 🔧 Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm, **or** Docker with Compose v2 ([DOCKER_LABS.md](../../documentation/getting-started/DOCKER_LABS.md))
- One-time repo setup (`./scripts/setup/setup.sh` from the repo root; [SETUP.md](../../documentation/getting-started/SETUP.md)) — not needed for the Docker path

### Docker (no host Node)

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec victim bash
# inside container: cd victim-app && npm start
# on host: curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data
docker compose down -v
```

Exfiltration still goes to the mock on localhost inside the lab network.

### Environment Setup

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
./setup.sh
```

`./setup.sh` creates directories, seeds `malicious-packages/request-lib/` from the template, installs victim app dependencies, and writes `infrastructure/mock-server.js`. When setup finishes, it prints the same commands as **Run the lab** below.

## Run the lab

Use two terminals. All paths are relative to `scenarios/01-typosquatting`.

### Terminal A — mock attacker server

```bash
node infrastructure/mock-server.js
```

Leave this running. Exfiltration only runs when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled` and posts to `http://localhost:3000/collect`.

### Terminal B — review, install typo, run victim

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled

cat legitimate/requests-lib/index.js
cat templates/malicious-package-template.js

cd victim-app
npm install ../malicious-packages/request-lib
npm start
```

### Verify capture

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

Clear captured data between runs: `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/captured-data`.

### Blue team (optional)

From the repository root:

```bash
node detection-tools/package-scanner.js scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app
./detection-tools/network-monitor.sh
```

## 📝 Lab Tasks

The sections below expand on **Run the lab** with analysis, detection, and prevention exercises.

### Part 1: Understanding the Target (15 minutes)

The legitimate package we'll target is called `requests-lib` (a fictional popular package).

**Your Tasks**:
1. Examine the legitimate package at `./legitimate/requests-lib/`
2. Understand what it does and how it's used
3. Identify potential typo variations

**Questions to Answer**:
- What are common typos users might make?
- Which characters are easily confused? (l vs 1, 0 vs O, etc.)
- How could you make a malicious package look legitimate?

### Part 2: Create the Typosquatted Package (20 minutes)

**Your Mission**: Create a malicious package named `request-lib` (missing 's')

**Requirements**:
1. The package must provide the same basic functionality as the original
2. It should exfiltrate data without obvious detection
3. The malicious behavior should be hidden or obfuscated

**Implementation Steps**:

1. If `./setup.sh` already created `malicious-packages/request-lib/`, edit that tree. Otherwise create it and copy from `./templates/malicious-package-template.js`.

2. Follow the template in `./templates/malicious-package-template.js`

3. Your malicious code should:
   - Exfiltrate environment variables
   - Send data to a mock server (localhost only in testbench)
   - Still provide working functionality to avoid suspicion

**Safety Guardrails**:
- Your code MUST check for `process.env.TESTBENCH_MODE === 'enabled'`
- Exfiltration MUST only go to localhost:3000 (mock server)
- Include clear comments marking malicious sections

### Part 3: Deploy and Test (15 minutes)

Follow **Run the lab** above for the executable path. This lab simulates a typo with a local path install (`npm install ../malicious-packages/request-lib`), not a public registry publish.

After `npm start`, confirm exfiltration with `curl -s http://localhost:3000/captured-data`.

### Part 4: Detection (20 minutes)

Now switch to the defender role. Your task is to detect the malicious package.

**Detection Methods**:

1. **Manual Code Review**:
```bash
cd node_modules/request-lib
cat package.json
cat index.js
```

Look for:
- Suspicious network requests
- Obfuscated code
- Unexpected dependencies
- Post-install scripts

2. **Automated Scanning** (from the **repository root**):
```bash
node detection-tools/package-scanner.js scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app
```

3. **Behavioral Analysis** (from the **repository root**):
```bash
./detection-tools/network-monitor.sh
```

**Questions**:
- What red flags did you find?
- Which detection method was most effective?
- Could this have been prevented?

### Part 5: Prevention & Mitigation (15 minutes)

Implement defenses:

1. **Package Lock Files**:
   - Examine how `package-lock.json` can help
   - Practice integrity checking

2. **Registry Security**:
   - Configure npm to verify package signatures
   - Set up scope restrictions

3. **Automated Tools**:
   - Configure Socket.dev integration
   - Set up Snyk scanning

4. **Code Review Checklist**:
   - Create a checklist for reviewing new dependencies

## Mitigation Playbook

- Commit `package-lock.json` and use `npm ci` in production pipelines.
- Configure registry scope restrictions and verify package signatures where supported.
- Run automated dependency scanning (e.g. `npm audit`, Snyk, Socket.dev).
- Require a code-review checklist for every new dependency (name, maintainer, reputation).
- Prefer private registries and scope-based routing for internal package names.

## ✅ Success Criteria

You've completed this scenario when you can:
- [ ] Successfully create a typosquatted package
- [ ] Demonstrate data exfiltration in the test environment
- [ ] Detect the malicious package using multiple methods
- [ ] Implement at least 3 preventive measures
- [ ] Explain the attack to a colleague

## 🎁 Bonus Challenges

1. **Advanced Obfuscation**: Use more sophisticated hiding techniques
2. **Unicode Tricks**: Create a package using Unicode lookalike characters
3. **Dependency Chain**: Hide malicious code in a sub-dependency
4. **Time-Delayed Attack**: Make the malicious behavior trigger after a delay
5. **Environment Detection**: Make it only activate in production environments

## 🆘 Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1: How to exfiltrate data</summary>

Use Node.js `http` or `https` modules to send data:
```javascript
const http = require('http');

function exfiltrate(data) {
  if (process.env.TESTBENCH_MODE !== 'enabled') return;
  
  const payload = JSON.stringify(data);
  const options = {
    hostname: 'localhost',
    port: 3000,
    path: '/collect',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  };
  
  // Send data (testbench environment only)
}
```
</details>
