# Supply Chain Attack Test Bench

Local labs for learning how software supply chain attacks work - and how to spot and stop them.

[![Smoke](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/actions/workflows/smoke.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/actions/workflows/smoke.yml)

## Start here

Pick one path. The rest of the docs are linked so you do not have to read this whole file.

| You are... | Do this |
|----------|---------|
| New to the project | `./START_HERE.sh` (menu: labs / workshop / docker). Then `source .scas.env`. First lab is 01. [Zero to hero](documentation/getting-started/ZERO_TO_HERO.md) · [Workshop stack](documentation/getting-started/FULL_STACK_SETUP.md) |
| Prefer Docker | Option 3 in `./START_HERE.sh`, or `./docker/install.sh` · [Docker labs](documentation/getting-started/DOCKER_LABS.md) |
| Pi / USB HDD host | Optional: [`install-external.sh`](install-external.sh) - [Pi storage](documentation/getting-started/RASPBERRY_PI_STORAGE.md) |
| Prefer a browser UI | [Dashboard](documentation/platform/DASHBOARD.md) - `./scripts/ui/start-dashboard.sh` (localhost only) |
| Teaching or building a curriculum | [Scenario learning path](documentation/learning-path/SCENARIO_LEARNING_PATH.md) |
| Already comfortable with npm and VMs | [Quick start](#quick-start-experienced-users) below, then open each scenario's README |

**Safety:** Education only, in isolated environments. Read [Safety & ethics](#safety--ethics) before you run anything.

## What this is

Twenty-three small labs under `scenarios/` (`01-` through `23-`). Each one walks through an attack, shows how you might detect it, and points at mitigations. You mostly work from the CLI; there is an optional [localhost dashboard](documentation/platform/DASHBOARD.md) if you want a UI.

Guides and learning paths live in [`documentation/`](documentation/index.md). Malicious bits only run when you opt in (for example `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`), and exfiltration stays aimed at localhost - see [Security notice](#security-notice).

## Themes (not a full catalog)

The labs cover a few broad areas:

- Package and registry abuse - typosquatting, dependency confusion, mirrors, lockfiles, caches, workspaces
- Broken trust - bad updates, signing gaps, submodules, SBOM tricks
- Build and delivery - pipelines, containers, multi-stage chains
- Developer tools - plugins, self-spreading patterns ([`06-sha-hulud/`](scenarios/06-sha-hulud/)), IDE/CLI-style risks
- Incident-style sims - Axios-like npm and LiteLLM-like PyPI patterns (fake packages, localhost only; [#3](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/issues/3), [#4](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/issues/4))
- Defense - detection tooling and hardening, threaded through the scenarios

For the full numbered list, see [Scenario walkthroughs](documentation/reference/SCENARIOS.md).

## Prerequisites

- Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL2
- Python 3.8+, Node.js 16+, Git (Docker if you use the full stack or Docker labs)
- Basic comfort with npm/pip is enough to start

```

## Quick start (experienced users)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator.git
cd supply-chain-attack-simulator
```

Use your own fork URL if that is what you cloned.

### 2. Install

Canonical command: `./START_HERE.sh` (same as `./install.sh`). No flags opens a menu:

```text
  1) Labs only      Node/Python. No Docker. Fast path.
  2) Workshop stack npm workspaces, Elasticsearch/Kibana, Floci.
  3) Docker labs    exec ./docker/install.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x START_HERE.sh
./START_HERE.sh
source .scas.env
```

Non-interactive workshop (`-y` still means ES + Floci, needs Docker):

```bash
./START_HERE.sh -y
source .scas.env
```

Labs only, no Docker services:

```bash
./START_HERE.sh -y --core-only
```

### 3. Run Scenario 1 (CLI)

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
./setup.sh
node infrastructure/mock-server.js &
cd victim-app
npm install ../malicious-packages/request-lib
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
npm start
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

You should see captured exercise data from the mock exfiltration endpoint (exact shape is described in `scenarios/01-typosquatting/README.md`).

### 4. Clean up

```bash
./scripts/setup/kill-port.sh 3000
# or everything:
./scripts/setup/teardown.sh
```

## Scenario index

Each folder's README has the steps. Levels match [documentation/reference/SCENARIOS.md](documentation/reference/SCENARIOS.md).

## Defense and detection

Every scenario ships a `DETECT.md` with IOCs, sample logs, and rule-style snippets, plus notes on mitigation in the README.

For workshops, you can send runbooks and events into a local Elasticsearch stack ([#22](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/issues/22)):

```bash
./scripts/observability/elasticsearch-up.sh
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
```

See [observability/README.md](observability/README.md).

## Safety & ethics

This repo is for learning. Keep it that way.

- Run it only in isolated environments
- Do not publish these packages to public registries
- Do not point it at systems you do not own
- Be careful with anything that looks like a real credential

The samples are labeled as educational, gated for the testbench, and written so they should not do real damage when used as documented.

## Security notice

There is intentionally bad code here. Safeguards include:

- `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled` (and similar) before malicious paths run
- Localhost-oriented exfiltration and mocks
- Clear warnings in the labs
- No real credential harvesting

## Issue templates

Under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`: bug report, feature request, and scenario issue forms.

## Learning path

There is no single required order. A workable default:

1. Do **01 → 02 → 03** first.
2. Finish **01-05** before **06** (Shai-Hulud) - it is the heaviest single lab.
3. After that, pick by interest: registry/repo labs (**07, 08, 10, 12, 13, 16**), or CI/signing/container labs (**05, 09, 11, 14, 15, 17-23**).
