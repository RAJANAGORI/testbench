## Start here

Pick **one** path; everything else links out so you are not stuck in a long README.

| You are… | Do this |
|----------|---------|
| **New to the project** | `./install.sh -y` (SCAS + ES + Floci) · [Full-stack setup](documentation/getting-started/FULL_STACK_SETUP.md) · or `./START_HERE.sh` |
| **Pi / USB HDD host** | Optional: [`install-external.sh`](install-external.sh) then same stack — [Pi storage](documentation/getting-started/RASPBERRY_PI_STORAGE.md) |
| **Prefer a browser UI** | [Dashboard](documentation/platform/DASHBOARD.md) — `./scripts/ui/start-dashboard.sh` (localhost only) |
| **Planning teaching or a curriculum** | Use the [Scenario learning path](documentation/learning-path/SCENARIO_LEARNING_PATH.md) (beginner → intermediate → advanced) |
| **Comfortable with npm, shells, and isolated VMs** | [Quick Start](#quick-start-experienced-users) below, then open the README inside each scenario folder |

**Safety:** This repo is for **education in isolated environments only**. Read [Safety & ethics](#safety--ethics) before running anything.

## Overview

This test bench provides hands-on scenarios for supply chain attacks—among the most critical risks in modern software development. Learners set up intentionally vulnerable environments, walk through attacks, practice detection, and implement defenses. The default runtime is **CLI-only**; an optional [localhost dashboard](documentation/platform/DASHBOARD.md) is available.

**At a glance**

- **23** self-contained labs under `scenarios/` (numbered folders `01-` … `23-`)
- Each lab includes attack mechanics, detection ideas, mitigations, and references where relevant
- Canonical guides and learning paths live in [`documentation/`](documentation/index.md)
- Malicious samples are gated (for example `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`) and designed for localhost-style exercises—see [Security notice](#security-notice)

## What you'll learn (themes)

Instead of listing every technique here, the labs group into a few themes:

- **Package and registry abuse** — typosquatting, dependency and version confusion, mirrors, metadata, lockfiles, caches, workspaces
- **Compromise of trust** — hijacked or malicious updates, signing bypass, submodules, SBOM gaps
- **Build, CI/CD, and delivery** — pipeline tampering, container images, multi-stage chains
- **Developer toolchain** — plugins, “Shai-Hulud” / self-spreading patterns, IDE–CLI style risks ([scenario folder `06-sha-hulud/`](scenarios/06-sha-hulud/) uses the short name **sha-hulud** on disk)
- **Realistic simulations** — Axios-style npm and LiteLLM-style PyPI patterns (fictional packages, localhost-only; see issues [#3](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/issues/3) and [#4](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/issues/4))
- **Defense** — detection tooling, hardening patterns, and defensive workflows across scenarios

For a **full numbered list** with paths and skills, see [Scenario walkthroughs](documentation/reference/SCENARIOS.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Operating system**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL2
- **Software**: Python 3.8+, Node.js 16+, Git
- **Knowledge**: Basic familiarity with package managers (npm, pip, and similar)
- **Runtime model**: CLI-only (no dashboard or web UI required)

```

## Quick Start (experienced users)

### 1. Clone and enter the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator.git
cd supply-chain-attack-simulator
```

Use your own fork or mirror URL if you did not clone from GitHub.

### 2. Run the installer

**Full stack** (SCAS + Elasticsearch/Kibana + Floci — Docker required):

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh -y
source .scas.env
```

**Core only** (labs without Docker services):

```bash
./install.sh -y --core-only
# or: chmod +x scripts/setup/setup.sh && ./scripts/setup/setup.sh
```

### 3. Run Scenario 1 (example CLI flow)

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
./setup.sh
node infrastructure/mock-server.js &
cd victim-app
npm install ../malicious-packages/request-lib
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
npm start
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

You should see captured exercise data from the mock exfiltration endpoint (exact shape is described in `scenarios/01-typosquatting/README.md`).

### 4. Clean up the scenario port

```bash
./scripts/setup/kill-port.sh 3000
```

Or clean up all testbench processes and local scenario artifacts:

```bash
./scripts/setup/teardown.sh
```

## Scenario index

## Defense & detection

Each scenario includes:

- Detection techniques and tools
- Mitigation strategies
- Prevention-oriented practices
- Real-world case studies where relevant
- A blue-team runbook at `scenarios/<scenario>/DETECT.md` with IOCs, sample logs, Sigma-style rules, and YARA-like text matches

### Optional Elasticsearch + Kibana track

For workshops, you can index all detection runbooks and runtime events into a local Docker stack (roadmap issue [#22](https://github.com/RAJANAGORI/supply-chain-attack-simulator/issues/22)):

```bash
./scripts/observability/elasticsearch-up.sh
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200   # opt-in live capture forwarding
```

See [observability/README.md](observability/README.md) for Kibana data views, shippers, and smoke checks.

## Safety & ethics

**IMPORTANT**: This test bench is for **educational purposes only**.

- Use **only** in isolated environments
- Never deploy malicious code to public repositories
- Do not test on systems you do not own
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

All malicious packages in this test bench are:

- Clearly labeled as educational
- Designed to work only in the test environment
- Intended not to cause real harm when used as documented

## Security notice

This repository contains intentionally vulnerable code and malicious package examples for educational purposes. Safeguards reduce accidental misuse:

- Environment variable checks (for example `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`)
- Localhost-oriented operations
- Clear warning messages
- No real credential harvesting

## Issue templates

GitHub issue forms live under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`:

- `bug_report.yaml`
- `feature_request.yaml`
- `scenario_issue.yaml`

## Learning path (how to order the labs)

There is **no single mandatory order** for all 23 scenarios. Use this as a rule of thumb, then follow **[Scenario learning path](documentation/learning-path/SCENARIO_LEARNING_PATH.md)** for tracks and outcomes.

1. **Foundation**: Complete **01 → 02 → 03** (typosquatting, dependency confusion, compromised package) before deep dives.
2. **Before scenario 06**: Finish **01–05** first. **06 (Shai-Hulud)** is the heaviest “single scenario” lab and assumes you understand earlier mechanics and response concepts.
3. **Everything else**: Choose by role—intermediate registry and repo labs (for example **07, 08, 10, 12, 13, 16**), advanced CI and signing labs (**05, 09, 11, 14, 15, 17–23**) as needed. Enterprise-focused notes apply especially to **11** (mirrors); container tooling to **14**; scanner/toolchain trust to **23**.

Capstone-style work is described in the **[Capstone rubric](documentation/learning-path/CAPSTONE_RUBRIC.md)**.
