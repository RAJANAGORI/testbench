## Part 1: Understanding Package Lock Files (15 minutes)

### What is a Package Lock File?

A **package lock file** (`package-lock.json` for npm, `yarn.lock` for yarn, `pnpm-lock.yaml` for pnpm) is a file that locks the exact versions of all dependencies, including transitive dependencies.

**Purpose**:
- Ensures reproducible installs
- Locks exact versions of all packages
- Includes transitive dependencies
- Used by `npm ci` for clean installs

### Why Lock Files Exist

**Without lock file**:
```bash
npm install express  # Might install express@4.18.1 or 4.18.2 (whatever is latest)
```

**With lock file**:
```bash
npm ci  # Installs EXACT versions from package-lock.json
```

**Example package-lock.json**:
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "lockfileVersion": 2,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.18.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-..."
    }
  }
}
```

### How npm Uses Lock Files

1. **npm install**: Uses lock file if present, updates it if dependencies change
2. **npm ci**: Uses lock file EXCLUSIVELY, ignores package.json dependencies
3. **Lock file priority**: Lock file takes precedence over package.json

**Critical Point**: `npm ci` trusts the lock file completely!

### Why Lock Files Are Trusted

- **Reproducibility**: Ensures everyone gets same versions
- **CI/CD**: Build systems use lock files for consistency
- **Security**: Locks known-good versions
- **Speed**: Faster installs (no resolution needed)

---

## Part 2: Understanding Lock File Manipulation (15 minutes)

### What is Lock File Manipulation?

**Lock File Manipulation** occurs when an attacker modifies `package-lock.json` (or pairs it with a sneaky manifest change) to steer installs toward malicious artifacts. On **npm 7+**, the lockfile root is reconciled with `package.json`, so “lock-only” injections without a matching dependency line are usually dropped on `npm install`. This lab uses an explicit **`file:`** `evil-utils` entry in `package.json` so installs are reproducible while you still practice **lock review**, integrity checks, and unexpected local-package detection.

### Attack Scenario

1. **Attacker manipulates package-lock.json**: Adds malicious package entry
2. **Commits to repository**: Lock file changes are committed
3. **Developer pulls changes**: Gets manipulated lock file
4. **Runs npm install/ci**: Installs malicious package from lock file
5. **Malicious code executes**: Postinstall script runs automatically

### Why This Attack Works

1. **Trust**: Package managers trust lock files completely
2. **Easy to miss**: `file:` and tarball specifiers are easy to skim past in both `package.json` and the lockfile
3. **CI/CD Vulnerability**: `npm ci` uses lock file exclusively
4. **Persistent**: Changes persist through git commits
5. **Review Bypass**: Security reviews focus on package.json, not lock files

### Real-World Attack Vectors

1. **Compromised Git Repository**: Attacker commits manipulated lock file
2. **Malicious Pull Request**: PR includes lock file with malicious packages
3. **CI/CD Compromise**: Attacker modifies lock file in build artifacts
4. **Developer Machine Compromise**: Attacker modifies local lock file

---

## Part 3: Prerequisites Check (5 minutes)

Before we start, make sure you've completed:

- ✅ Scenario 1 (Typosquatting) - Understanding basic attacks
- ✅ Scenario 2 (Dependency Confusion) - Understanding package resolution
- ✅ Scenario 3 (Compromised Package) - Understanding package compromise
- ✅ Node.js 16+ and npm installed
- ✅ TESTBENCH_MODE enabled

Verify your setup:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
echo $TESTBENCH_MODE  # Should output: enabled
```

---

## Part 4: Setting Up Scenario 8 (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to Scenario Directory

```bash
cd scenarios/08-package-lock-file-manipulation
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
./setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Creates directory structure
- Sets up legitimate app (clean baseline)
- Sets up victim app (`evil-utils` file: dependency + lockfile)
- Sets up compromised app (pre-manipulated state)
- Creates malicious package (evil-utils)
- Sets up detection tools
- Sets up mock attacker server

**Expected output:**
- Setup progress messages
- Directories and files created
- Three app states created
- "Next Steps" displayed

### Step 3: Understand the Three App States

**1. legitimate-app/**: Clean baseline
- Clean package.json and package-lock.json
- No malicious packages
- Reference for comparison

**2. victim-app/**: Active compromise
- `package.json` includes `evil-utils` as `file:../malicious-packages/evil-utils`
- Lockfile records the link and install scripts
- After `./setup.sh`, dependencies are installed

**3. compromised-app/**: Same dependency model for demos
- Same `evil-utils` `file:` line; run `npm install` when you want a fresh `node_modules` for teaching

---

## Part 5: Understanding the Attack Structure (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Examine the Legitimate App

```bash
cd legitimate-app
cat package.json
```

**What you'll see:**
```json
{
  "name": "legitimate-app",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  }
}
```

```bash
cat package-lock.json | head -50
```

**What you'll see:**
- Clean lock file
- Only express and lodash
- No malicious packages

### Step 2: Examine the Victim App

```bash
cd ../victim-app
cat package.json
```

**Notice**: `victim-app/package.json` lists **`evil-utils`** as a **`file:`** dependency (legitimate-app does not). That is the signal to investigate.

```bash
cat package-lock.json | grep -A 10 "evil-utils"
```

**What you'll see:** entries under the root `packages` tree linking `node_modules/evil-utils` to `../malicious-packages/evil-utils`.

**Key Point**: Compare **legitimate-app** vs **victim-app** `package.json` and lockfile together—unexpected `file:` deps and lock drift are the lesson.

### Step 3: Compare the Files

```bash
# Compare package.json files (victim includes evil-utils file:)
diff legitimate-app/package.json victim-app/package.json

# Compare package-lock.json files (victim/evil-utils linkage)
diff legitimate-app/package-lock.json victim-app/package-lock.json | head -50
```

**Findings:**
- package.json: ❌ Different (victim-app declares `evil-utils`)
- package-lock.json: ❌ Different (victim-app resolves and records `evil-utils`)

---

## Part 6: The Attack - Lock File Manipulation (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Understand How the Manipulation Works

The attacker (or insider) has:
1. Added a **`file:`** dependency on `evil-utils` in `package.json`
2. Committed the updated lockfile that materializes that link
3. Relied on reviewers skimming past `file:` lines or huge lock diffs

**In real attack:**
- Attacker commits manifest + lock changes
- Lockfile-only tweaks still happen in weaker pipelines, but npm 7+ usually requires a matching manifest line for the root dependency
- CI/CD runs `npm ci` / `npm install` and postinstall hooks may run

### Step 2: Start the Mock Attacker Server

```bash
cd infrastructure
node mock-server.js &
```

**Verify it's running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data
# Should return: {"captures":[]}
```

### Step 3: Examine the Malicious Package

```bash
cd ../malicious-packages/evil-utils
cat package.json
```

**What you'll see:**
```json
{
  "name": "evil-utils",
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node postinstall.js"
  }
}
```

**Key Feature**: Has a postinstall script!

```bash
cat postinstall.js | head -30
```

**What it does:**
- Executes automatically when installed
- Collects system information
- Reads sensitive files
- Exfiltrates data to attacker server

### Step 4: Simulate the Attack

```bash
cd ../../victim-app

# Clean install (simulates CI/CD environment)
rm -rf node_modules

# Install from manipulated lock file
npm install
# OR use npm ci (which ONLY uses lock file)
# npm ci
```

**What happens:**
1. npm reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
2. Links `evil-utils` from the declared `file:` path
3. Runs `evil-utils` **postinstall** when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`
4. Data is collected and exfiltrated to the mock server
5. Check the mock server console for captured data!

### Step 5: Observe the Attack

```bash
# Check the mock server output
# You should see:
# 🎯 CAPTURED DATA FROM LOCK FILE MANIPULATION
# Package: evil-utils@1.0.0
# Lock File Manipulated: true
# ... system information ...
```

```bash
# Or check via API
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data | jq
```

**What was exfiltrated:**
- System information (hostname, username, platform)
- Environment variables
- Contents of sensitive files (.npmrc, .env)
- Lock file contents (confirms manipulation)

### Step 6: Verify the Package is Installed

```bash
# Check installed packages
npm list --depth=0

# You should see evil-utils@1.0.0 linked from file:
```

```bash
# Confirm the manifest declares the local package
cat package.json | grep evil-utils
```

**Key Point**: The **`file:`** line in `package.json` is what npm 7+ needs to keep the root lock entry stable; the lockfile still deserves diff review.

### Step 7: Run the Victim Application

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
npm start
```

**Notice**: The application runs normally! You might not notice anything wrong.

**Key Point**: The attack executed during `npm install`, not during application runtime.

---

## Part 7: Detection Methods (40 minutes)

### Detection Method 1: Lock File Validation

```bash
cd detection-tools
node lock-file-validator.js ../victim-app
```

**What this does:**
- Compares `package.json` with the lockfile root (including lockfile v3 `packages[""]`)
- Flags suspicious package names and **`file:`** specifiers
- Notes **postinstall** on **file:** dependencies

**Expected Output:** warnings for `evil-utils` as a `file:` dependency and for postinstall on that local package (exact wording may vary by npm lock shape).

### Detection Method 2: Manual Comparison

```bash
cd ../victim-app

# Compare package.json with package-lock.json
node -e "
const pkg = require('./package.json');
const lock = require('./package-lock.json');
const pkgDeps = Object.keys({...pkg.dependencies, ...pkg.devDependencies});
const lockDeps = Object.keys(lock.dependencies || {});
const unexpected = lockDeps.filter(d => !pkgDeps.includes(d) && !d.startsWith('@types/'));
console.log('Expected packages:', pkgDeps);
console.log('Packages in lock file:', lockDeps);
console.log('Unexpected packages:', unexpected);
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Expected packages: [ 'express', 'lodash' ]
Packages in lock file: [ 'express', 'lodash', 'evil-utils', ... ]
Unexpected packages: [ 'evil-utils' ]
```

### Detection Method 3: Git History Analysis

```bash
# If using git, check lock file changes
git log -p package-lock.json | head -100

# Check for suspicious additions
git diff HEAD~1 package-lock.json | grep -A 10 "evil-utils"

# Check commit author
git log -1 --format="%an - %s" package-lock.json
```

**What to look for:**
- Unexpected lock file changes
- Packages added without corresponding package.json changes
- Suspicious commit messages
- Unknown commit authors

### Detection Method 4: Package Verification

```bash
# Check installed packages
npm list --depth=0

# Verify package integrity
npm audit

# Spot packages beyond the benign public deps you expect
npm list --depth=0 | grep -v "express\|lodash"
```

**Red Flags:**
- Unexpected `file:` or tarball specifiers in `package.json`
- Integrity check failures
- Unexpected packages in node_modules

### Detection Method 5: Runtime Detection

```bash
# Check if malicious package is loaded
node -e "try { require('evil-utils'); console.log('⚠️  evil-utils is installed!'); } catch(e) { console.log('✅ Not installed'); }"

# Check captured data (indicates attack occurred)
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data | jq '.captures[0].data.lockFileManipulated'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
⚠️  evil-utils is installed!
true
```

---

## Part 8: Forensic Investigation (30 minutes)

### Investigation Step 1: Lock File Analysis

```bash
cd victim-app

# Lockfile v3: root dependency keys
node -e "const l=require('./package-lock.json'); console.log(Object.keys((l.packages&&l.packages['']&&l.packages[''].dependencies)||{}));"

# Inspect the linked package entry
cat package-lock.json | jq '.packages["node_modules/evil-utils"]'
```

**Key Findings:**
- Package name: evil-utils
- Linked from `../malicious-packages/evil-utils` in the lockfile `packages` tree

### Investigation Step 2: Package.json Comparison

```bash
# Compare what should be installed vs what is installed
echo "=== Expected (package.json) ==="
cat package.json | jq '.dependencies'

echo ""
echo "=== Lockfile root dependency keys (v3 uses packages[\"\"]) ==="
node -e "const l=require('./package-lock.json'); const r=(l.packages&&l.packages['']&&l.packages[''].dependencies)||{}; console.log(Object.keys(r));"
```

**Findings:**
- `package.json` lists `evil-utils` as `file:../malicious-packages/evil-utils`
- Lockfile records the link under `packages["node_modules/evil-utils"]` (and related entries)

### Investigation Step 3: Git History Analysis

```bash
# Check when lock file was modified (if using git)
git log --oneline package-lock.json

# See the exact changes
git show HEAD:package-lock.json | grep -A 10 "evil-utils" || echo "Not in current version"

# Check commit details
git log -1 --format="%an - %ae - %s - %ad" package-lock.json
```

**Timeline Questions:**
- When was the lock file manipulated?
- Who committed the change?
- What was the commit message?
- Was it part of a larger change?

### Investigation Step 4: Impact Assessment

```bash
# Check what data was exfiltrated
cat ../infrastructure/captured-data.json | jq '.captures[0].data'

# Identify affected systems
cat ../infrastructure/captured-data.json | jq '.captures[].data.hostname'
```

**Impact:**
- System information collected
- Sensitive files accessed (.npmrc, .env)
- Lock file contents exfiltrated
- Confirms lock file manipulation

---

## Part 9: Incident Response (30 minutes)

### Response Step 1: Immediate Containment

```bash
cd victim-app

# Remove malicious package (if installed)
npm uninstall evil-utils

# Remove node_modules
rm -rf node_modules

# Restore lock file from git (if available)
git checkout HEAD -- package-lock.json

# OR regenerate from package.json
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Response Step 2: Lock File Restoration

```bash
# Option 1: Restore from git
git checkout HEAD~1 -- package-lock.json  # Restore previous version

# Option 2: Regenerate from package.json
rm package-lock.json
npm install

# Verify new lock file is clean
node ../detection-tools/lock-file-validator.js .
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check lock file no longer contains evil-utils
cat package-lock.json | grep evil-utils
# Should return nothing
```

### Response Step 3: CI/CD Security Update

**Update CI/CD Pipeline** to validate lock files:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Validate lock file
  run: |
    node scripts/validate-lock-file.js
    npm audit
    npm ci --dry-run

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
```

### Response Step 4: Long-term Defenses

**Implement Multiple Layers:**

1. **Lock File Validation in CI/CD**:
   ```bash
   # Add to CI/CD pipeline
   node detection-tools/lock-file-validator.js .
   ```

2. **Git Hooks**:
   ```bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit
   #!/bin/bash
   node detection-tools/lock-file-validator.js .
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "Lock file validation failed!"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Package.json Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Verify all packages in lock file are in package.json
   node -e "
   const pkg = require('./package.json');
   const lock = require('./package-lock.json');
   const pkgDeps = Object.keys({...pkg.dependencies, ...pkg.devDependencies});
   const lockDeps = Object.keys(lock.dependencies || {});
   const unexpected = lockDeps.filter(d => !pkgDeps.includes(d) && !d.startsWith('@types/'));
   if (unexpected.length > 0) {
     console.error('Unexpected packages:', unexpected);
     process.exit(1);
   }
   "
   ```

4. **Lock File Checksums**:
   ```bash
   # Generate checksum
   sha256sum package-lock.json > package-lock.json.sha256
   
   # Verify in CI/CD
   sha256sum -c package-lock.json.sha256
   ```

---

## Part 10: Defense Strategies (20 minutes)

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Lock File Validation**: Always validate before install
2. **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks to validate lock files
3. **CI/CD Checks**: Automated validation in pipelines
4. **Code Reviews**: Review lock file changes carefully
5. **Checksums**: Store and verify lock file checksums

### Detection Strategies

1. **Automated Validation**: Regular lock file validation
2. **Package Comparison**: Compare package.json with lock file
3. **Git History Review**: Review lock file changes in commits
4. **Integrity Checks**: Verify package integrity hashes
5. **Unexpected Package Detection**: Alert on undeclared installs, suspicious names, and **`file:`** / tarball specifiers

### Response Strategies

1. **Immediate Removal**: Remove malicious packages
2. **Lock File Restoration**: Restore from git or regenerate
3. **Impact Assessment**: Determine scope of compromise
4. **Credential Rotation**: Rotate potentially compromised credentials
5. **Incident Documentation**: Document attack and response

## Mitigation Playbook

Canonical prevention and mitigation controls (aligned with the [scenario README](../../../scenarios/08-package-lock-file-manipulation/README.md)). Lab walkthroughs above expand each control with hands-on steps.

- Validate lockfiles before install in CI and locally.
- Use git pre-commit hooks to detect unexpected lockfile changes.
- Require careful code review of every `package-lock.json` diff.
- Store and verify lockfile checksums as part of release gates.
- Compare `package.json` declared deps against lockfile entries automatically.
- Verify package integrity hashes match trusted registry metadata.

*Code-level workflow for Scenario 08. Editable source: [`scas-codeflow-scenario-08.excalidraw`](../../assets/diagrams/codeflow/excalidraw/scas-codeflow-scenario-08.excalidraw). Regenerate with `node scripts/diagrams/generate-scenario-codeflow-diagrams.js`.*

---

## Elasticsearch + Kibana observability (optional)

Scenario **08 — Package Lock File Manipulation** is indexed in Elasticsearch when the observability stack is running.

Lockfile manipulation: tampered package-lock.json installs evil-utils instead of the intended package.

- **Detection runbook (static)** → index `scas-rules`, document id `08` — IOCs, Sigma, YARA, sample logs from `DETECT.md`
- **Runtime captures (dynamic)** → index `scas-detections` — one document per exfil event when `SCAS_ES_URL` is set before starting the mock collector

### How to read this diagram

| Phase | What you should look for |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **1 — Collectors** | Terminal A starts the mock server (or harvester). Set `SCAS_ES_URL` here if you want live Elasticsearch indexing. |
| **2 — Lab execution** | Terminal B runs the scenario README steps. See the **sequence diagram** and **Scenario-specific attack steps** below. |
| **3 — Exfiltration** | Malicious sample sends **localhost-only** JSON to the mock endpoint. Evidence is always written to `infrastructure/` on disk. |
| **4 — Elasticsearch** | When `SCAS_ES_URL` is set, the same capture is indexed into `scas-detections` with `scenario_id` and `event_type=exfil_capture`. |
| **5 — Kibana** | Use the per-scenario saved searches to compare **runtime captures** (Detections) with the **static runbook** (Rules). |

> **Safety:** All network calls stay on `127.0.0.1`. Malicious logic runs only when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`.

### Scenario-specific attack steps (Phase 2)

Same Phase-2 path as the diagrams above (for skimming / accessibility).

| # | From | To | Action |
|---|------|----|--------|
| 1 | Learner | Victim | npm install (honors manipulated package-lock.json) |
| 2 | Victim | MalPkg | Install evil-utils from lockfile entry |
| 3 | MalPkg | MalPkg | postinstall / load hook fires during install |

### Prerequisites

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/observability/elasticsearch-up.sh
./scripts/observability/setup-kibana-data-views.sh   # data views + saved searches for all 23 scenarios
```

### Run this scenario with live Elasticsearch forwarding

**Terminal A — mock collector** (from `scenarios/08-package-lock-file-manipulation`):

```bash
cd scenarios/08-package-lock-file-manipulation
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
node infrastructure/mock-server.js
```

**Terminal B — execute the lab:**

```bash
cd scenarios/08-package-lock-file-manipulation
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
cd victim-app && npm install && npm start
```

> **Note:** Stop mock-server before npm start if port 3000 conflicts with victim Express app.

### Verify locally (file-based evidence)

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

### Verify in Elasticsearch (API)

```bash
# Static runbook for this scenario
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-rules/_doc/08?pretty"

# Latest runtime capture events
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-detections/_search?pretty" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": { "term": { "scenario_id": "08" } },
    "sort": [{ "@timestamp": "desc" }],
    "size": 5
  }'

### Verify in Kibana (UI)

1. Open [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
2. **Discover** → **SCAS Detections — Scenario 08** — live capture timeline (`@timestamp`, `package.name`, `detail`)
3. **Discover** → **SCAS Rules — Scenario 08** — compare against `iocs`, `sigma`, and `yara` fields
4. Ask: *Does each capture field match an IOC or Sigma condition in the runbook?*

## Part 11: Key Takeaways (10 minutes)

### Why Lock Files Are Risky

1. **Complete Trust**: Package managers trust lock files completely
2. **CI/CD Dependency**: `npm ci` uses lock file exclusively
3. **Easy to miss**: `file:` lines and huge lock diffs hide in review
4. **Persistent Attack**: Changes persist through commits
5. **Review Bypass**: Often overlooked in security reviews

### Best Practices

1. ✅ **Always validate lock files** - Use automated tools
2. ✅ **Review lock file changes** - In git commits and PRs
3. ✅ **Use git hooks** - Pre-commit validation
4. ✅ **CI/CD validation** - Automated checks in pipelines
5. ✅ **Compare with package.json** - Ensure consistency
6. ✅ **Store checksums** - Verify lock file integrity
7. ✅ **Monitor for unexpected packages** - Automated alerts

### CI/CD Security Implications

- **npm ci trusts lock file**: No validation against package.json
- **Build systems vulnerable**: Lock file manipulation affects CI/CD
- **Wide impact**: Affects entire development team
- **Detection time**: Average 30+ days to detect
