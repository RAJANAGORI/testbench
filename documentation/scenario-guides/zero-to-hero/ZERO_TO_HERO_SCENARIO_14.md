## Part 1: Understanding Container Image Supply Chain Attacks (15 minutes)

### What Is a Container Image Supply Chain Attack?

A **container image supply chain attack** compromises the trust consumers place in image contents — not just known vulnerabilities, but **what actually runs when the container starts**. Attackers alter entrypoints, inject startup scripts, or embed hidden network beacons that execute before your application logic.

**Typical image structure**:
```
my-app-image/
├── Dockerfile          # Build instructions
├── app.js              # Expected application entrypoint
└── malicious-start.js  # Hidden attacker script (compromised image)
```

### Why Container Security Is More Than CVE Scanning

1. **CVE scans miss behavior**: An image can have zero CVEs and still beacon data at startup
2. **Tag mutability**: Same tag (`latest`) can point to different digests over time
3. **Entrypoint drift**: `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` changes are easy to miss in review
4. **Build-time vs runtime**: Malicious code may not appear in application source repos
5. **Network at boot**: Containers often have egress; startup scripts exploit this immediately

### Visual Example: Legitimate vs Compromised Dockerfile

**Legitimate image** (`images/legitimate-image/Dockerfile`):
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.js .
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

**Compromised image** (`images/compromised-image/Dockerfile`):
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.js .
CMD ["node", "malicious-start.js"]
```

**The only visible change**: Entrypoint switched from `app.js` to `malicious-start.js`.

### How Container Image Attacks Work

**The Attack Chain**:
```
Attacker modifies image build pipeline or registry tag
        ↓
Image passes superficial review (same base, same tag name)
        ↓
Container starts with malicious entrypoint
        ↓
Startup script beacons host metadata to attacker endpoint
        ↓
Application may appear to run normally (or script runs standalone)
```

### Why Container Image Attacks Are Risky

1. **Implicit trust in tags**: Teams pull `:latest` without digest pinning
2. **CI/CD blind spots**: Pipelines verify app code but not final image CMD
3. **Runtime visibility gaps**: Startup beacons happen before app logging initializes
4. **Host bridge abuse**: Scripts target `host.docker.internal` to reach host-side collectors
5. **Wide deployment**: One bad image affects every environment that pulls it

### Real-World Examples

- **SolarWinds-style build compromise**: Trusted build produces untrusted artifacts
- **Registry substitution**: Attacker pushes to wrong registry namespace
- **Base image drift**: Malicious layer added during CI build
- **Entrypoint injection**: Hidden script added in final Dockerfile layer

**Key insight**: "No critical CVEs" ≠ "Safe to run."

---

## Part 2: Prerequisites Check (5 minutes)

Before we start, make sure you've completed:

- ✅ Scenario 1 (Typosquatting) — basic supply chain trust concepts
- ✅ Node.js 16+ installed
- ✅ TESTBENCH_MODE enabled
- ✅ Docker installed (optional — lab works without Docker via runtime script)

Verify your setup:

```bash
node --version
echo $TESTBENCH_MODE  # Should output: enabled
docker --version      # Optional
```

If `TESTBENCH_MODE` is not set:

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
```

---

## Part 3: Setting Up Scenario 14 (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to Scenario Directory

```bash
cd scenarios/14-container-image-supply-chain-attack
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
./setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Creates `images/legitimate-image/` and `images/compromised-image/`
- Prepares `victim-app/` reference layout
- Initializes `infrastructure/captured-data.json`
- Creates `detection-tools/image-scanner.js`
- Sets up mock collector on port **3002**

**Expected output:**
- Setup progress messages
- Numbered lab flow printed to terminal

### Step 3: Understand the Environment

**The Scenario Structure**:
```
14-container-image-supply-chain-attack/
├── images/
│   ├── legitimate-image/     # Benign Dockerfile + app.js
│   └── compromised-image/    # Malicious CMD + malicious-start.js
├── victim-app/               # Reference consumer layout
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── mock-server.js        # Attacker collector (port 3002)
│   └── captured-data.json    # Runtime evidence
└── detection-tools/
    └── image-scanner.js      # Static Dockerfile scanner
```

**The Attack**:
- Compromised image runs `malicious-start.js` instead of `app.js`
- Startup script beacons to `host.docker.internal:3002` (Docker) or fails gracefully locally
- Mock server receives `POST /capture` payloads
- Static scanner flags known malicious entrypoint patterns

---

## Part 4: Understanding the Image Structure (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Examine the Legitimate Image

```bash
cat images/legitimate-image/Dockerfile
```

**What you'll see:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.js .
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

**Notice**: Standard Node.js Alpine base, single application entrypoint.

```bash
cat images/legitimate-image/app.js
```

**What you'll see:**
- Benign application logic
- No outbound network calls
- No environment harvesting

### Step 2: Examine the Compromised Image

```bash
cat images/compromised-image/Dockerfile
```

**What you'll see:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.js .
CMD ["node", "malicious-start.js"]
```

**Key Change**: CMD points to `malicious-start.js` instead of `app.js`.

### Step 3: Inspect the Malicious Startup Script

```bash
cat images/compromised-image/malicious-start.js
```

**What it does:**
- Checks `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled` before malicious behavior
- Collects hostname via `os.hostname()`
- Sends JSON payload to `host.docker.internal:3002` at path `/capture`
- Keeps process alive with idle interval (simulates long-running container)

**Why `host.docker.internal`?**
- Docker containers use this hostname to reach services on the host
- In this lab, the mock server runs on the host at port 3002
- Static scanner flags this as a suspicious pattern

### Step 4: Side-by-Side Dockerfile Diff

```bash
diff images/legitimate-image/Dockerfile images/compromised-image/Dockerfile
```

**Expected diff:**
```
4c4
< CMD ["node", "app.js"]
---
> CMD ["node", "malicious-start.js"]
```

**Key Point**: A one-line CMD change is enough to compromise every container pulled from this image definition.

---

## Part 5: The Attack - Compromised Container Startup (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Understand the Attack Timeline

**Scenario**: An attacker modified the image build pipeline, replacing the application entrypoint with a malicious startup script.

**Attack Timeline**:
1. Attacker modifies Dockerfile or build template
2. Image built and tagged with familiar name
3. CI/CD or operator pulls and runs image
4. Container executes `malicious-start.js` at boot
5. Beacon sent to attacker collector on port 3002

### Step 2: Start the Mock Attacker Server

Open **Terminal A**:

```bash
cd scenarios/14-container-image-supply-chain-attack
node infrastructure/mock-server.js
```

**What this does:**
- Listens on `127.0.0.1:3002`
- Accepts `POST /capture`
- Appends entries to `infrastructure/captured-data.json`

**Verify it's running:**
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3002/captured-data
# Should return: []
```

### Step 3: Static Detection First (Blue Team Preview)

Open **Terminal B** — run scanner before executing attack:

```bash
cd scenarios/14-container-image-supply-chain-attack
node detection-tools/image-scanner.js images/compromised-image
```

**Expected output:**
```
Potential issues found:
- known malicious entrypoint
```

**What this proves**: Static analysis can catch compromise **before** runtime.

### Step 4: Runtime Simulation (Without Docker)

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
node images/compromised-image/malicious-start.js
```

**What happens:**
- Script attempts beacon to `host.docker.internal:3002`
- On macOS, `host.docker.internal` may resolve; on Linux you may need Docker or hosts entry
- Mock server may receive capture if routing succeeds

**Check captures:**
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3002/captured-data | jq
```

### Step 5: Optional Docker Validation

If Docker is available:

```bash
docker build -t scas-legit images/legitimate-image
docker build -t scas-compromised images/compromised-image
docker run --rm -e TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway scas-compromised
```

**What this does:**
- Builds both image variants locally
- Runs compromised image with testbench flag enabled
- Maps `host.docker.internal` to host gateway for beacon delivery

**Verify capture after Docker run:**
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3002/captured-data | jq
```

**What was exfiltrated:**
- Container/host hostname
- Timestamp (`ts` field)

### Step 6: Compare Legitimate vs Compromised Behavior

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
node images/legitimate-image/app.js
# Benign application output only — no network beacon
```

**Key Point**: Legitimate image produces expected app behavior; compromised image prioritizes beacon at startup.

---

## Part 6: Detection Methods (40 minutes)

### Detection Method 1: Image Scanner (Static)

```bash
node detection-tools/image-scanner.js images/compromised-image
```

**What this checks:**
- Network fetch patterns in Dockerfile (`curl`, `wget`)
- References to `host.docker.internal`
- Known malicious entrypoint filename (`malicious-start.js`)

**Exit code 2** indicates findings — integrate into CI image build gates.

### Detection Method 2: Dockerfile Diff Against Baseline

```bash
diff -u images/legitimate-image/Dockerfile images/compromised-image/Dockerfile
```

**Red flags:**
- CMD/ENTRYPOINT changes without approved change ticket
- New COPY lines for unknown scripts
- RUN instructions pulling remote content

### Detection Method 3: Entrypoint/CMD Policy Check

```bash
grep -E 'CMD|ENTRYPOINT' images/*/Dockerfile
```

**What to look for:**
- Unexpected script names in CMD array
- Shell-form CMD hiding commands (`CMD node malicious-start.js` vs exec form)

### Detection Method 4: Runtime Network Monitoring

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3002/captured-data | jq
```

**What to look for:**
- HTTP POST at container start (before app ready)
- Destinations to unknown hostnames or ports
- Payloads containing hostname/metadata fields

### Detection Method 5: Process Tree Inspection (Production Parallel)

In production Kubernetes/Docker environments, look for:
- Unexpected `node malicious-start.js` in container PID 1
- Child processes spawning before application server
- Immediate outbound connections on container start

**Sample log line for this scenario:**
```json
{"scenario_id":"14","event_type":"container_startup_beacon","source":"malicious-start.js","destination":"127.0.0.1:3002","timestamp_utc":"2026-04-20T13:05:00Z"}
```

### Detection Method 6: Sigma Rule (from DETECT.md)

```yaml
title: Container Startup Script Unexpected Network Beacon
detection:
  selection:
    process.command_line|contains: "node malicious-start.js"
    network.destination.port: 3002
  condition: selection
level: high
```

---

## Part 7: Forensic Investigation (30 minutes)

### Investigation Step 1: Image Definition Analysis

```bash
# Preserve Dockerfile evidence
cp images/compromised-image/Dockerfile /tmp/compromised-dockerfile.forensics

# List all files in compromised image context
ls -la images/compromised-image/
```

**Questions:**
- Who approved the CMD change?
- When was the image last rebuilt?
- Does registry digest match expected signed attestation?

### Investigation Step 2: Startup Script Forensics

```bash
cat images/compromised-image/malicious-start.js
```

**Document:**
- Network destination (`host.docker.internal:3002`, path `/capture`)
- Safety gate (`TESTBENCH_MODE`) — lab only
- Data fields collected (`host`, `ts`)

### Investigation Step 3: Capture Timeline

```bash
cat infrastructure/captured-data.json | jq '.[] | {received_at, payload}'
```

**Build Timeline:**
- T0: Container start / script execution
- T1: Outbound POST to port 3002
- T2: Capture written to `captured-data.json`
- T3: Application (if any) continues or script holds process open

### Investigation Step 4: Deployment Impact Assessment

**Questions for a real incident:**
- Which clusters/namespaces pulled this image tag?
- Was digest pinned or tag-only pull used?
- How many running pods use compromised entrypoint?
- Are secrets mounted into affected containers?

### Investigation Step 5: Static vs Runtime Evidence Correlation

```bash
# Static finding
node detection-tools/image-scanner.js images/compromised-image

# Runtime finding
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3002/captured-data | jq
```

**Strongest case**: Scanner flagged entrypoint **before** deploy; runtime beacon confirms exploitation path.

---

## Part 8: Incident Response & Mitigation (30 minutes)

### Response Step 1: Immediate Containment

```bash
# Stop mock server
../../scripts/setup/kill-port.sh 3002

# Stop running compromised containers (Docker)
docker ps --filter ancestor=scas-compromised -q | xargs -r docker stop
```

**Production parallels:**
- Halt deployments using affected image tag/digest
- Quarantine nodes running compromised containers
- Block egress from affected namespaces pending review

### Response Step 2: Roll Back to Known-Good Image

```bash
docker build -t scas-legit images/legitimate-image
docker run --rm scas-legit
# Verify benign startup only
```

**Production parallels:**
- Redeploy last known-good immutable digest
- Invalidate CI cache for compromised build pipeline
- Rotate secrets accessible to affected containers

### Response Step 3: Long-term Defenses

**Implement Multiple Layers**:

1. **Image Provenance & Signing**:
   - Require cosign/sigstore verification before pull
   - Reject unsigned images in admission controllers

2. **Immutable Digests**:
   ```bash
   # Pull by digest, not tag
   docker pull myregistry/app@sha256:abc123...
   ```

3. **Policy Gates for CMD/ENTRYPOINT**:
   ```bash
   node detection-tools/image-scanner.js images/compromised-image
   # Fail CI on non-zero exit
   ```

4. **Runtime Network Controls**:
   - Default-deny egress for build jobs and sensitive workloads
   - Alert on startup-time outbound connections

5. **Reproducible Builds**:
   - Pin base image digests
   - Generate and store build attestations (SLSA)

6. **Separate Vulnerability vs Trust Scanning**:
   - CVE scan answers "known bugs?"
   - Trust verification answers "expected contents and entrypoint?"

---

## Mitigation Playbook

Canonical prevention and mitigation controls (aligned with the [scenario README](../../../scenarios/14-container-image-supply-chain-attack/README.md)). Lab walkthroughs above expand each control with hands-on steps.

- Enforce image provenance and signature verification in CI/CD.
- Pin immutable image digests (not mutable tags only).
- Add policy checks for entrypoint/CMD changes on critical images.
- Restrict outbound network from build and runtime where possible.
- Require reproducible image builds and signed attestations.

## Code-level workflow

*Code-level workflow for Scenario 14. Editable source: [`scas-codeflow-scenario-14.excalidraw`](../../assets/diagrams/codeflow/excalidraw/scas-codeflow-scenario-14.excalidraw). Regenerate with `node scripts/diagrams/generate-scenario-codeflow-diagrams.js`.*

## Elasticsearch + Kibana observability (optional)

Scenario **14 — Container Image Supply Chain** is indexed in Elasticsearch when the observability stack is running.

Container supply chain: compromised-image entrypoint sends build-time payload to mock-server :3002.

- **Detection runbook (static)** → index `scas-rules`, document id `14` — IOCs, Sigma, YARA, sample logs from `DETECT.md`
- **Runtime captures (dynamic)** → index `scas-detections` — one document per exfil event when `SCAS_ES_URL` is set before starting the mock collector

### How to read this diagram

| Phase | What you should look for |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **1 — Collectors** | Terminal A starts the mock server (or harvester). Set `SCAS_ES_URL` here if you want live Elasticsearch indexing. |
| **2 — Lab execution** | Terminal B runs the scenario README steps. See the **sequence diagram** and **Scenario-specific attack steps** below. |
| **3 — Exfiltration** | Malicious sample sends **localhost-only** JSON to the mock endpoint. Evidence is always written to `infrastructure/` on disk. |
| **4 — Elasticsearch** | When `SCAS_ES_URL` is set, the same capture is indexed into `scas-detections` with `scenario_id` and `event_type=exfil_capture`. |
| **5 — Kibana** | Use the per-scenario saved searches to compare **runtime captures** (Detections) with the **static runbook** (Rules). |

> **Safety:** All network calls stay on `127.0.0.1`. Malicious logic runs only when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`.

### Scenario-specific attack steps (Phase 2)

Same Phase-2 path as the diagrams above (for skimming / accessibility).

| # | From | To | Action |
|---|------|----|--------|
| 1 | Learner | Victim | TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled node images/compromised-image/malicious-start.js |
| 2 | Victim | MalPkg | Compromised image layer / entrypoint runs |

### Prerequisites

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/observability/elasticsearch-up.sh
./scripts/observability/setup-kibana-data-views.sh   # data views + saved searches for all 23 scenarios
```

### Run this scenario with live Elasticsearch forwarding

**Terminal A — mock collector** (from `scenarios/14-container-image-supply-chain-attack`):

```bash
cd scenarios/14-container-image-supply-chain-attack
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
node infrastructure/mock-server.js
```

**Terminal B — execute the lab:**

```bash
cd scenarios/14-container-image-supply-chain-attack
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled node images/compromised-image/malicious-start.js
```

### Verify locally (file-based evidence)

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3002/captured-data
```

### Verify in Elasticsearch (API)

```bash
# Static runbook for this scenario
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-rules/_doc/14?pretty"

# Latest runtime capture events
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-detections/_search?pretty" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": { "term": { "scenario_id": "14" } },
    "sort": [{ "@timestamp": "desc" }],
    "size": 5
  }'
```

### Verify in Kibana (UI)

1. Open [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
2. **Discover** → **SCAS Detections — Scenario 14** — live capture timeline (`@timestamp`, `package.name`, `detail`)
3. **Discover** → **SCAS Rules — Scenario 14** — compare against `iocs`, `sigma`, and `yara` fields
4. Ask: *Does each capture field match an IOC or Sigma condition in the runbook?*

See [observability/README.md](../../../observability/README.md) for stack details.

## Part 9: Key Takeaways

### Why Container Image Attacks Are Dangerous

1. **Trust in tags**: Mutable tags hide digest changes
2. **Startup blind spot**: Beacons fire before application logs exist
3. **CMD drift**: One-line Dockerfile changes compromise all pulls
4. **Host bridge paths**: `host.docker.internal` reaches host-side services
5. **CVE-only mindset**: Clean scan results create false confidence

### Best Practices

1. ✅ **Pin image digests** — never rely on tags alone
2. ✅ **Verify signatures and provenance** in CI/CD and admission control
3. ✅ **Policy-check CMD/ENTRYPOINT** changes on critical images
4. ✅ **Restrict outbound network** at build and runtime
5. ✅ **Monitor startup network activity** in orchestrators
6. ✅ **Maintain signed baseline images** for diff comparison
7. ✅ **Separate vulnerability scanning from trust verification**

### Real-World Impact

- **Wide deployment**: One image affects every environment that pulls it
- **Stealthy indicators**: Startup beacons resemble health checks
- **Detection time**: Often discovered only after anomaly detection on egress
- **Recovery cost**: Rolling digest-pinned redeploys across all clusters

---

## Part 10: Advanced Exercises

### Exercise 1: Admission Controller Policy
- Write a Kyverno/OPA rule rejecting images whose CMD contains unknown scripts
- Test against legitimate and compromised Dockerfiles in this lab

### Exercise 2: Digest-Pinned Pipeline
- Modify a sample CI job to build, sign, and deploy by digest only
- Document rollback procedure using previous digest

### Exercise 3: Runtime Detection Tuning
- Map DETECT.md Sigma rule to your container runtime logs
- Define alert severity when startup POST occurs within 30s of container start

### Exercise 4: Docker vs Non-Docker Paths
- Compare capture success running `malicious-start.js` directly vs in Docker
- Document when `host.docker.internal` resolution succeeds on your OS
- Propose lab-friendly hosts-file workaround for Linux learners

## ⚠️ Safety & Ethics

**IMPORTANT**: This scenario is for **educational purposes only**.

- ✅ Use ONLY in isolated test environments
- ✅ Never push compromised images to public registries
- ✅ All malicious behavior requires `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`
- ✅ Exfiltration targets localhost / `host.docker.internal:3002` only
- ✅ Do not run compromised images on production systems

---

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've completed the Container Image Supply Chain Attack scenario! You now understand:
- How entrypoint drift compromises container trust
- How to detect malicious startup scripts statically and at runtime
- How to defend with provenance, digest pinning, and network controls

**Remember**: CVE-free images can still be malicious. Verify what runs at container start, not just what's in the vulnerability database.

🔐 Happy Learning!
