## Part 1: Understanding the Basics (5 minutes)

### What is a Supply Chain Attack?

A **supply chain attack** happens when attackers compromise software by targeting the tools, libraries, or processes that developers use to build applications. Instead of attacking the final application directly, they attack the "supply chain" - the dependencies and tools.

**Real-world example**: Imagine you're building a house. Instead of breaking into your house, an attacker sneaks a faulty lock into the hardware store. When you buy and install that lock, your house becomes vulnerable.

### What is Typosquatting?

**Typosquatting** is when attackers create malicious packages with names very similar to popular legitimate packages, hoping developers will make a typo and accidentally install the malicious one.

**Example**: 
- Legitimate package: `requests-lib` (with an 's')
- Malicious package: `request-lib` (missing the 's')

If a developer types `npm install request-lib` instead of `npm install requests-lib`, they might install the malicious package!

---

## Part 2: Prerequisites Check (10 minutes)

Before we start, let's make sure you have everything you need.

### Step 1: Check Your Operating System

This project works on:
- ✅ macOS (you're on macOS!)
- ✅ Linux
- ✅ Windows with WSL2

### Step 2: Check if Node.js is Installed

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
node --version
```

**If you see a version number** (like `v18.17.0` or higher):
- ✅ You're good to go! Skip to Step 3.

**If you see "command not found"**:
- You need to install Node.js. Here's how:

#### Installing Node.js on macOS:

**Option A: Using Homebrew (Recommended)**
```bash
# First, install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Node.js
brew install node
```

**Option B: Download from Website**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version
3. Run the installer
4. Restart your terminal

After installing, verify:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Both should show version numbers.

### Step 3: Verify Git is Installed

```bash
git --version
```

Git usually comes pre-installed on macOS. If not, install it:
```bash
brew install git
```

---

## Part 3: Setting Up the Project (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

You're already in the project! But let's make sure we're in the right place:

```bash
# Check where you are
pwd

# You should see something like:
# /path/to/testbench
```

If you're not in the testbench directory, navigate there:
```bash
cd /path/to/testbench
```

### Step 2: Enable Testbench Mode (Safety Feature)

This is a safety feature that ensures malicious code only works in our test environment:

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
```

To make this permanent (so you don't have to type it every time), add it to your shell configuration:

```bash
# For zsh (default on macOS)
echo 'export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify it's set
echo $TESTBENCH_MODE
# Should output: enabled
```

### Step 3: Run the Main Setup Script

This script will:
- Check all your prerequisites
- Create necessary directories
- Install dependencies
- Set up the environment

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup/setup.sh

# Run the setup
./scripts/setup/setup.sh
```

**What to expect:**
- The script will check your system
- It will ask for confirmation (type `y` and press Enter)
- It will install dependencies (this might take a few minutes)

**If you see any errors:**
- Read the error message carefully
- Most common issues are missing Node.js or npm
- Refer to Part 2 to install missing prerequisites

### Step 4: Start the Mock Server (CLI)

We'll start the mock server manually (in a separate terminal) when needed:

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
node infrastructure/mock-server.js &
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

---

## Part 4: Understanding the First Scenario (10 minutes)

### What We're Going to Do

In this scenario, you'll play three roles:

1. **Attacker**: Create a malicious package that looks like a legitimate one
2. **Victim**: Accidentally install the malicious package (simulating a typo)
3. **Defender**: Detect and analyze the malicious package

### The Scenario Setup

- **Legitimate Package**: `requests-lib` (a fictional popular HTTP library)
- **Malicious Package**: `request-lib` (missing the 's' - a common typo)
- **Victim App**: A simple application that needs the HTTP library
- **Mock Server**: Receives the "stolen" data (localhost only, safe!)

---

## Part 5: Setting Up Scenario 1 (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to the Scenario Directory

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
```

### Step 2: Run the Scenario Setup Script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Creates the malicious package structure
- Sets up the victim application
- Creates a mock server to receive data
- Installs necessary dependencies

**Expected output:**
- You'll see setup progress messages
- It will create directories and files
- At the end, it will show "Next Steps"

### Step 3: Start the Mock Attacker Server

This server will receive the data that the malicious package tries to "steal". In a real attack, this would be an attacker's server, but in our test environment, it's just localhost.

Start it manually (in a separate terminal):

```bash
# Make sure you're in the scenario directory
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting

# Start the mock server in the background
node infrastructure/mock-server.js &
```

**Verify the server is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

You should see: `{"captures": []}` (empty because no data has been captured yet)

---

## Part 6: Understanding the Packages (15 minutes)

Before we execute the attack, let's understand what we're working with.

### Step 1: Look at the Legitimate Package

```bash
# View the legitimate package code
cat legitimate/requests-lib/index.js
```

**What to notice:**
- It's a simple HTTP request library
- It has functions like `get()` and `post()`
- It's clean, straightforward code
- No suspicious behavior

### Step 2: Look at the Malicious Package Template

```bash
# View the malicious package template
cat templates/malicious-package-template.js
```

**What to notice:**
- It provides the SAME functionality as the legitimate package (to avoid suspicion)
- But it ALSO has malicious code that:
  - Collects environment variables
  - Sends data to an attacker server
  - Runs automatically when the package is imported

**Key safety features:**
- Only works when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`
- Only sends to `localhost:3000` (not real attackers)
- Clearly marked as educational

### Step 3: Understand the Victim Application

```bash
# View the victim app
cat victim-app/index.js
```

**What to notice:**
- It's a simple application
- It tries to use `requests-lib` (the legitimate package)
- But due to a typo, it might install `request-lib` (the malicious one)

---

## Part 7: Executing the Attack (20 minutes)

Now for the fun part! Let's see the attack in action.

### Step 1: Create the Malicious Package

The setup script should have already created this, but let's verify:

```bash
# Check if the malicious package exists
ls -la malicious-packages/request-lib/
```

You should see:
- `index.js` (the malicious code)
- `package.json` (package metadata)

If it doesn't exist, the setup script creates it automatically. Let's check the package.json:

```bash
cat malicious-packages/request-lib/package.json
```

**Notice:**
- Name is `request-lib` (missing the 's')
- Description mentions it's for educational purposes

### Step 2: Install the Malicious Package (Simulating the Typo)

Now we'll simulate what happens when a developer makes a typo:

```bash
# Navigate to the victim application
cd victim-app

# Install the malicious package (simulating a typo)
npm install ../malicious-packages/request-lib
```

**What just happened:**
- We installed the malicious package
- The package's code ran automatically when installed
- It tried to "steal" data and send it to the attacker server

### Step 3: Run the Victim Application

```bash
# Make sure TESTBENCH_MODE is enabled
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled

# Run the application
npm start
```

**What to expect:**
- The application will start
- You might see some console output
- The malicious code will execute in the background

### Step 4: Check What Data Was "Stolen"

Now let's see what the malicious package captured:

```bash
# In a new terminal window, check the captured data
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

**What you should see:**
A JSON object with captured data, including:
- Environment variables (NODE_ENV, PWD, USER)
- System information (platform, Node.js version)
- Timestamp of when it was captured

You can also export this captured JSON (for example):

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data > captured-data.json
```

### Step 5: Understand What Happened

**The Attack Flow:**
1. Developer intended to install `requests-lib` (legitimate)
2. Made a typo and installed `request-lib` (malicious)
3. Malicious package ran automatically when imported
4. It collected sensitive information (environment variables, system info)
5. Sent that data to the attacker's server (localhost:3000 in our test)

**In a real attack:**
- The data would go to an attacker's real server
- The attacker could use this information to:
  - Access your systems
  - Steal API keys and passwords
  - Understand your infrastructure
  - Plan further attacks

---

## Part 8: Detecting the Attack (15 minutes)

Now let's switch roles and become defenders. How can we detect this malicious package?

### Method 1: Manual Code Review

Let's look at what was actually installed:

```bash
# Go back to the victim app directory
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app

# Look at what's in node_modules
cat node_modules/request-lib/index.js | head -50
```

**Red flags to look for:**
- ✅ Network requests on module load
- ✅ Access to `process.env` (environment variables)
- ✅ Data collection and transmission
- ✅ Suspicious function names like "exfiltrateData"
- ✅ Code that runs automatically when imported

### Method 2: Check Package Metadata

```bash
# Check the package.json of the installed package
cat node_modules/request-lib/package.json
```

**Things to check:**
- Package name (does it look suspicious?)
- Author information
- Version history
- Dependencies

### Method 3: Network Monitoring

Let's see what network requests were made:

```bash
# If you have the network monitor tool
cd ../../detection-tools
./network-monitor.sh
```

Or check the mock server logs to see what requests were received.

### Method 4: Use Automated Scanning Tools

```bash
# Navigate to detection tools
cd detection-tools

# Run the package scanner
node package-scanner.js ../scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app
```

This tool will scan for:
- Suspicious network requests
- Data exfiltration patterns
- Anomalous behavior

---

## Part 9: Prevention and Best Practices (10 minutes)

Now that we've seen how the attack works, how can we prevent it?

### Prevention Strategy 1: Use Package Lock Files

```bash
# Check if package-lock.json exists
ls -la scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app/package-lock.json
```

**What it does:**
- Locks exact versions of all packages
- Prevents accidental installation of different packages
- Provides integrity checking

**Best practice:**
- Always commit `package-lock.json` to version control
- Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in production

### Prevention Strategy 2: Verify Package Names Carefully

**Before installing:**
- Double-check the package name
- Look at the package's npm page
- Check download statistics
- Read reviews and GitHub stars

**Red flags:**
- Very low download count
- Recently created package
- Suspicious author information
- No GitHub repository

### Prevention Strategy 3: Use Automated Security Tools

**Tools to consider:**
- **npm audit**: Built into npm, scans for known vulnerabilities
- **Snyk**: Commercial security scanning
- **Socket.dev**: Detects suspicious package behavior
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

**Try it:**
```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app
npm audit
```

### Prevention Strategy 4: Code Review Process

**Before adding new dependencies:**
1. Review the package source code
2. Check the package's GitHub repository
3. Look for recent suspicious changes
4. Verify the package maintainer's identity
5. Check for security advisories

### Prevention Strategy 5: Use Private Registries

For internal packages:
- Use private npm registries
- Configure scope-based registry routing
- Implement access controls

---

## Mitigation Playbook

Canonical prevention and mitigation controls (aligned with the [scenario README](../../../scenarios/01-typosquatting/README.md)). Lab walkthroughs above expand each control with hands-on steps.

- Commit `package-lock.json` and use `npm ci` in production pipelines.
- Configure registry scope restrictions and verify package signatures where supported.
- Run automated dependency scanning (e.g. `npm audit`, Snyk, Socket.dev).
- Require a code-review checklist for every new dependency (name, maintainer, reputation).
- Prefer private registries and scope-based routing for internal package names.

---

## Elasticsearch + Kibana observability (optional)

Scenario **01 - Typosquatting** is indexed in Elasticsearch when the observability stack is running.

Typosquatting: a mistyped package name (`request-lib`) is installed, executes on import, and beacons to the mock server.

- **Detection runbook (static)** → index `scas-rules`, document id `01` - IOCs, Sigma, YARA, sample logs from `DETECT.md`
- **Runtime captures (dynamic)** → index `scas-detections` - one document per exfil event when `SCAS_ES_URL` is set before starting the mock collector

### How to read this diagram

| Phase | What you should look for |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **1 - Collectors** | Terminal A starts the mock server (or harvester). Set `SCAS_ES_URL` here if you want live Elasticsearch indexing. |
| **2 - Lab execution** | Terminal B runs the scenario README steps. See the **sequence diagram** and **Scenario-specific attack steps** below. |
| **3 - Exfiltration** | Malicious sample sends **localhost-only** JSON to the mock endpoint. Evidence is always written to `infrastructure/` on disk. |
| **4 - Elasticsearch** | When `SCAS_ES_URL` is set, the same capture is indexed into `scas-detections` with `scenario_id` and `event_type=exfil_capture`. |
| **5 - Kibana** | Use the per-scenario saved searches to compare **runtime captures** (Detections) with the **static runbook** (Rules). |

> **Safety:** All network calls stay on `127.0.0.1`. Malicious logic runs only when `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`.

### Scenario-specific attack steps (Phase 2)

Same Phase-2 path as the diagrams above (for skimming / accessibility).

| # | From | To | Action |
|---|------|----|--------|
| 1 | Learner | Victim | npm install ../malicious-packages/request-lib |
| 2 | Learner | Victim | npm start (TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled) |
| 3 | Victim | MalPkg | require("request-lib") loads typosquatted module |
| 4 | MalPkg | MalPkg | Collect env vars + package metadata (lab-safe subset) |

### Prerequisites

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/observability/elasticsearch-up.sh
./scripts/observability/setup-kibana-data-views.sh   # data views + saved searches for all 29 scenarios
```

### Run this scenario with live Elasticsearch forwarding

**Terminal A - mock collector** (from `scenarios/01-typosquatting`):

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
node infrastructure/mock-server.js
```

**Terminal B - execute the lab:**

```bash
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
export SCAS_ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
cd victim-app && npm install ../malicious-packages/request-lib && npm start
```

### Verify locally (file-based evidence)

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/captured-data
```

### Verify in Elasticsearch (API)

```bash
# Static runbook for this scenario
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-rules/_doc/01?pretty"

# Latest runtime capture events
curl -s "http://localhost:9200/scas-detections/_search?pretty" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": { "term": { "scenario_id": "01" } },
    "sort": [{ "@timestamp": "desc" }],
    "size": 5
  }'
```

### Verify in Kibana (UI)

1. Open [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
2. **Discover** → **SCAS Detections - Scenario 01** - live capture timeline (`@timestamp`, `package.name`, `detail`)
3. **Discover** → **SCAS Rules - Scenario 01** - compare against `iocs`, `sigma`, and `yara` fields
4. Ask: *Does each capture field match an IOC or Sigma condition in the runbook?*

See [observability/README.md](../../../observability/README.md) for stack details.

## Part 10: Clean Up and Next Steps (5 minutes)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "TESTBENCH_MODE not enabled"

**Solution:**
```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
# Add to ~/.zshrc for persistence
```

### Problem: "Port 3000 already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port (edit mock-server.js)
```

### Problem: "Cannot find module"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Problem: "Mock server not receiving data"

**Solution:**
1. Verify mock server is running: `curl http://localhost:3000/captured-data`
2. Check TESTBENCH_MODE: `echo $TESTBENCH_MODE`
3. Restart the mock server
4. Check application logs for errors
