# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Answers for the most common questions when using the Supply Chain Attack Simulator.

## Safety and ethics

### Is this safe to run on my laptop?

Only in an **isolated lab environment** (VM or dedicated machine). Malicious samples are gated by `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled` and exfiltrate to **localhost only**, but you should still treat the repo as intentionally vulnerable code.

### Do I need internet access?

**npm/pip installs** may need network for dependencies. Exfiltration in labs does **not** contact external attacker infrastructure.

### Can I publish or deploy any of this code?

**No.** This is for education only. Do not publish malicious packages to public registries or deploy lab payloads outside isolated environments.

## Getting started

### Where do I start as a complete beginner?

1. Read [ZERO_TO_HERO.md](../getting-started/ZERO_TO_HERO.md)
2. Run `./START_HERE.sh` (menu: labs / workshop / docker; same as `./install.sh`) or follow [SETUP.md](../getting-started/SETUP.md)
3. Complete [Scenario 01](../../scenarios/01-typosquatting/) with [ZERO_TO_HERO_SCENARIO_01.md](../scenario-guides/zero-to-hero/ZERO_TO_HERO_SCENARIO_01.md)

### What's the difference between ZERO_TO_HERO.md and SUPPLY_CHAIN_ATTACKS_ZERO_TO_HERO.md?

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [ZERO_TO_HERO.md](../getting-started/ZERO_TO_HERO.md) | Short getting-started guide for your **first lab** |
| [learning-path/SUPPLY_CHAIN_ATTACKS_ZERO_TO_HERO.md](../learning-path/SUPPLY_CHAIN_ATTACKS_ZERO_TO_HERO.md) | Full **curriculum** across all scenarios |

### What order should I run scenarios?

See [SCENARIO_LEARNING_PATH.md](../learning-path/SCENARIO_LEARNING_PATH.md). Minimum: **01 → 02 → 03**. Finish **01-05** before **06 (Shai-Hulud)**.

## Running labs

### Why does nothing happen when I run the victim app?

Almost always **`TESTBENCH_MODE` is not set**:

```bash
export TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled
echo $TESTBENCH_MODE   # should print: enabled
```

### Port already in use (EADDRINUSE)

A previous mock server is still running:

```bash
./scripts/setup/kill-port.sh 3000
# or all known ports:
./scripts/setup/kill-port.sh --all
```

Port reference: [OPERATIONS.md](./OPERATIONS.md) · [CATALOG.md](../scenario-guides/CATALOG.md)

### Scenario 11 folders don't exist

Run setup first - it generates the lab tree:

```bash
cd scenarios/11-registry-mirror-poisoning
./setup.sh
```

### Scenario 08: victim app conflicts with mock server on port 3000

Stop the mock server before `npm start` on the victim Express app (documented in scenario README and zero-to-hero guide).

## Detection and blue team

### Where are IOCs and detection rules?

Every scenario: `scenarios/<folder>/DETECT.md`

Example: [scenarios/01-typosquatting/DETECT.md](../../scenarios/01-typosquatting/DETECT.md)

### How do I run the package scanner?

```bash
node detection-tools/package-scanner.js scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app
node detection-tools/package-scanner.js scenarios/01-typosquatting/victim-app --json
```

### How do I use Elasticsearch and Kibana?

See [DETECTION_AND_OBSERVABILITY.md](./DETECTION_AND_OBSERVABILITY.md) and [observability/README.md](../../observability/README.md).

---

## Observability

### Elasticsearch returns 404 for scas-detections

The index is created on first document. Run a scenario with `SCAS_ES_URL` set, or backfill:

```bash
node detection-tools/es/ship-captures.js
```

### Kibana Discover is empty

Create data views and saved searches:

```bash
./scripts/observability/setup-kibana-data-views.sh
```

### Smoke observability test fails on scanner findings

Scenario 01's package may produce **zero scanner findings** (subtle payload). The smoke script also runs `ship-captures.js` - ensure `captured-data.json` exists from a prior lab run.

---

## Documentation

### Which documentation is the source of truth?

**[`documentation/`](../README.md)** - this folder. The [`docs/`](../../docs/) folder adds GitHub Pages HTML and symlinks to the same Markdown.

### Where is the master index of all files?

[documentation index](../index.md) and the [scenario catalog](../scenario-guides/CATALOG.md).
