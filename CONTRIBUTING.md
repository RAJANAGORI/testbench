### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

By submitting a pull request or otherwise contributing code you did not write
as a maintainer, you certify that your contribution meets the
[Developer Certificate of Origin version 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/),
and you license that contribution under the **same terms as this repository**
(MIT for software; CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 for documentation under `documentation/`).

Sign your commits so this certification is recorded in git history:

```bash
git commit -s
```

That adds a `Signed-off-by` trailer. Pull requests without a sign-off may be
declined.

If you are unsure whether you have the right to contribute something (for
example code from your employer), resolve that **before** opening a PR.

## Before you start

- Use isolated test environments only (VM/container/local sandbox).
- Keep all attack simulation behavior gated behind `TESTBENCH_MODE=enabled`.
- Keep all simulated exfiltration localhost-only (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`).
- Never add real malware, live credentials, or public exfiltration endpoints.

## Local setup

```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup/setup.sh
./scripts/setup/setup.sh
```

Recommended toolchain:

- Node.js `20.x` (see `.nvmrc`)
- Python `3.11.x` (see `.python-version`)

## Project layout expectations

Most scenarios follow this pattern:

- `legitimate-*` and/or `compromised-*` or `malicious-packages/`
- `victim-app/`
- `infrastructure/`
- `detection-tools/`
- `setup.sh`
- `README.md`

For teaching consistency, use `documentation/modules/MODULE_TEMPLATE.md` when writing scenario documentation and module content.

## Add or update a scenario

1. Create or update the scenario directory under `scenarios/`.
2. Include a complete `README.md` with objectives, setup, attack flow, detection, and mitigations.
3. Add a `## Mitigation Playbook` section to the scenario `README.md` and a `## Mitigation` section to `DETECT.md` (see **Documentation maintenance** below).
4. Ensure all simulated malicious behavior is testbench-gated and local-only.
5. Add or update any scenario-specific detection scripts.
6. Validate your scenario end-to-end locally.

## Documentation maintenance

Scenario docs use shared tooling under `scripts/`. The **canonical reference** for every script and the doc-sync lifecycle is **[documentation/platform/TOOLING.md](documentation/platform/TOOLING.md)** — read it before changing scenario docs.

Quick version after editing scenario mitigations or headings:

```bash
node scripts/docs/sync-mitigation-gaps.js     # sync DETECT.md + README playbooks (01–06)
node scripts/docs/inject-markdown-toc.js all  # rebuild every Table of Contents
```

Canonical mitigation bullets live in `scripts/lib/mitigation-playbooks.js` — edit there first. Learner docs (`documentation/scenario-guides/zero-to-hero/`) carry a **Mitigation Playbook** + **Table of Contents**; blue-team `DETECT.md` runbooks carry detection content plus a short **Mitigation** section.

## Code style and scripts

- Prefer small, focused changes.
- Keep shell scripts portable and executable.
- Keep documentation clear and task-oriented.
- Use explicit safety warnings in new scenario docs.

## Testing requirements

Run these locally before opening a PR:

```bash
# Catches lab-count / index / public-doc drift (fast; also runs in CI)
node scripts/docs/check-info-consistency.js

# Catches Excalidraw/SVG diagram contract drift (nodes, edges, embeds, XML &)
node scripts/diagrams/check-diagram-assets.js

find scripts -name '*.sh' -type f -exec chmod +x {} +
./scripts/smoke/smoke-all-scenarios.sh
```

If your change only affects one scenario, you should still run that scenario fully and confirm capture output appears as expected. When you **add or remove a scenario**, update every public surface that states the lab count or lists `01–NN`, then re-run `check-info-consistency.js`. When you **edit diagrams**, update `scripts/lib/diagram-specs.js` if the story changed, keep `.excalidraw`+`.svg` pairs, then re-run `check-diagram-assets.js`.

## Pull request checklist

Use the PR template and make sure all items are addressed, especially:

- `TESTBENCH_MODE` guards are present.
- Exfiltration is localhost-only.
- Smoke test passes locally.
